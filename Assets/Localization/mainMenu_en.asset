    m_Localized: "We are Culex, a company specialized in developing XR solutions
      that are changing the way we experience the world around us. Through the use
      of Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR), we
      create innovative projects aimed at education, entertainment, and enhancing
      users\u2019 everyday experiences.\n\nOne such project is CulEd \u2013 an educational
      AR application designed for primary school students, which brings the nature
      of Croatia directly into their surroundings through augmented reality. The
      goal of the app is to encourage children to explore and learn about animals
      native to Croatia in a way that is interactive, fun, and visually engaging.\n\nThrough
      CulEd, users can select one of the offered native animals and observe its 3D
      model in their own environment. Each model features animated movement, realistic
      sound effects, and educational information such as habitat, diet, and interesting
      facts about the animal. This approach encourages children to actively explore,
      develop environmental awareness, and connect with nature through technology
      they are already familiar with."
